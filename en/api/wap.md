# Upay WAP API (In-App Web-based Payment)

For clients interested in developing mobile shopping websites, Upay provides a special WAP API to help them building mobile payment solutions within web browsers in apps such as Wechat and Alipay.


## Payment Scenario

- A customer visits your mobile website with a built-in web browser in a mobile payment app, such as Wechat;
- The customer initiate a payment (such as by clicking a pay button on your website), and the mobile payment client app will pop up a confirmation to ask for payment authorization;
- The customer confirm the payment (a password may be required), and your website will display the payment result to the customer.

## Before Integration

Before starting your integration process, please contact our sales representatives and technical support for implementation suggestions and provide your business information to apply for a set of vendor and merchant accounts for development and testing. The Wechat related information you provide must match those of your Wechat official account.

**Note:**

`terminal_sn` and `terminal_key` (your server can be viewed as a terminal in this case) are required to sign each of your WAP API request. To get your `terminal_sn` and `terminal_key`, your service needs to initiate an activation request once and only once for each terminal. Please refer to our [documentation](https://wosai.gitbooks.io/shouqianba-doc/content/en/api/admin_en.html) for detailed explanation of the activation process.

### Request Signature

#### Instruction

The following steps explains how to generate request signature:

1. Filter

	Make a copy of all your request parameters, remove `sign`, `sign_type` and any field that is of raw type (such as file byte stream) from the copy.

2. Sort

	Sort the parameters you get from step 1 by the first letter of the key into ascending alphabetic (ASCII) order. If the first letter of two or more parameter keys are the same, then sort these parameters using the second letter of the keys and so on.
	
3. Concatenate

	Format the sorted parameters into key-value pairs like `key=value` then concatenate these pairs with `&` into a string;
	
	Append `&key={your_terminal_key}` at the end of the string;
	
	Generate an MD5 digest (all uppercase) of the string, and the digest is your request signature.
	
#### Example

For request paramter as follows:

	{
		"terminal_sn": "123",
		"client_sn": "abc",
		"total_amount": "1"
	}

Sort the parameters and concatenate them into the following string:

	paramStr = "client_sn=abc&terminal_sn=123&total_amount=1"
	
Append your terminal key (e.g. "19b820737ace6937a7808c") at the end:

	packageStr = paramStr + "&key=19b820737ace6937a7808c"
	
Generate request signature:

	sign = md5(packageStr).toUppercase()

###  Additional Notes

Please use redirect (302) to visit `https://qr.shouqianba.com/gateway` inside the built-in browser of Wechat client app.

Example:

	<?php
		$paramsStr = "client_sn=test&operator=TEST&return_url=test&subject=TEST&terminal_sn=test&total_amount=3";
		$sign = strtoupper(md5($paramsStr.'&key=test'));
		$paramsStr = $paramsStr."&sign=".$sign;

		header("Location:https://qr.shouqianba.com/gateway?".$paramsStr);
	?>
